# ENBUILD SDK for Go - Amazon Q Improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed URL Construction Issue**
   - Identified and fixed an issue with double slashes in API URLs
   - Modified the URL handling logic to properly join base URLs with API paths
   - Ensured consistent URL handling for both custom and default base URLs

2. **Added Default Token Support**
   - Added a default token constant (`defaultToken`) to use when no token is provided
   - Modified the authentication logic to fall back to the default token when environment variable is not set
   - Enhanced security by masking tokens in debug output

3. **Improved Debug Output**
   - Added verbose logging for base URL and authentication token (masked)
   - Added request header logging in debug mode
   - Improved formatting of debug messages

4. **Updated Example Code**
   - Modified the example to work with default token when environment variable is not set
   - Simplified the example code for better readability

## Key Files Modified

- `pkg/enbuild/client.go`: Added default token and improved URL handling
- `pkg/enbuild/config.go`: Enhanced debug output and token handling
- `internal/request/http.go`: Added request header logging and improved debug output
- `examples/get_manifests.go`: Updated to work with default token

## Testing

The changes have been tested with:

- Custom token from environment variable
- Various combinations of the above

All tests pass successfully, with proper URL construction and authentication.
